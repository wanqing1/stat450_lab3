To find if bill length and species affect the bill depth of penguins, we will 
consider a linear regression model for now: bill depth = b0 + b1 * bill length + 
b2 * species + e (b represents beta here). After fitting the model, we need to 
verify if residuals are normally distributed and if the variance of residuals 
is constant among all fitted values.
